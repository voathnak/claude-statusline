# statusline — Claude Code footer

A two-line Claude Code status bar showing the active model, reasoning effort, the
active **account email**, your **5-hour** and **weekly** usage-limit remaining
percentages (with a reset countdown), the working directory, context usage, and
cumulative session tokens.

```
v1.5.0 · Opus 4.8 (1M ctx) · ⚙ medium · 👤 you@example.com · 5h: 92% (⏳ 4h28m) · wk: 98% · 📁 ~/project
23% ctx · ↑ 156.3k · ↓ 8.7k
```

- **Line 1:** version · model · `⚙ effort` · `👤 account` · 5h limit · weekly limit · `📁 cwd`
- The `👤 account` segment reads `oauthAccount.emailAddress` from
  `~/.claude.json` (honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) — with a multi-account switcher
  like [cswap](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap) it shows which account
  is currently live, next to that account's usage limits. Omitted if the file
  is missing/unreadable; disable with `STATUSLINE_SHOW_ACCOUNT=0`. On macOS a
  cswap switch shows up once Claude Code's ~30s Keychain cache expires.
- **Line 2:** context % · `↑` input tokens · `↓` output tokens (cumulative,
  deduplicated by `message.id` — the transcript repeats the same usage on every
  content-block line of a reply)
- Version first (always visible); path last (it varies in length).

## Install

This plugin ships the footer script plus an installer. Because a plugin's bundled
`settings.json` cannot set the **main** `statusLine` (Claude Code only allows
`agent` and `subagentStatusLine` there), activate the footer once with:

```
/statusline:install
```

That runs the bundled `scripts/install.sh`, which:

- copies `scripts/statusline.sh` → `~/.claude/statusline.sh`, and
- merges `"statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh",
  "refreshInterval": 5 }` into `~/.claude/settings.json`.

`refreshInterval` re-runs the footer every 5 seconds even while the session is
idle — without it Claude Code only re-renders on events (new assistant message,
`/compact`, mode changes), so the ⏳ countdown and 👤 account segments would go
stale between turns. Tune the number in `settings.json` if you like (min `1`;
each run re-reads the transcript, so very low values cost more on long
sessions) — the installer preserves your custom value on upgrade.

Both files are backed up first (`*.bak-<timestamp>`). The installer is
semver-aware and **will not downgrade** — pass `--force` to override. Open a new
session (or reload) to see the footer.

You can also run it directly:

```sh
./scripts/install.sh          # install or upgrade
./scripts/install.sh --force  # reinstall / allow downgrade
./scripts/install.sh --quiet  # errors only (what the auto-update hook uses)
```

## Auto-update

The plugin registers a `SessionStart` hook that runs the installer silently on
every session start. The installer no-ops when the deployed script is already
current, so the hook is effectively free — but the moment the plugin updates to
a newer version, the footer script and `settings.json` block are re-deployed
automatically. You only ever run `/statusline:install` once, at first install.

To make the *plugin itself* update without manual steps, enable auto-update for
this marketplace: `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** → `vk-statusline` → **Enable
auto-update** (third-party marketplaces have it off by default). Claude Code
then refreshes the marketplace and updates the plugin at session start, and the
hook deploys the new footer on the next session. The hook never downgrades: if
your deployed script is newer than the plugin's, it is left untouched.

## Context sidecar (interop with other tools)

Claude Code gives the **statusline** the authoritative context data
(`context_window.used_percentage`, `context_window_size`) but does **not**
include it in hook payloads. So on every render the script publishes a
per-session sidecar that hook-based tools can read:

- **Path:** `~/.claude/statusline-ctx/<session_id>.json`
  (directory overridable via `STATUSLINE_CTX_DIR` — mainly for testing).
- **Schema (v1):**

  ```json
  {"v": 1, "ts": 1720500000, "used_percentage": 42, "context_window_size": 200000,
   "transcript_path": "/path/to/session.jsonl", "transcript_size": 123456}
  ```

- Written atomically (temp file + rename); consumers can never see a partial
  file. Sidecars older than 7 days are pruned on write. Every step is
  failure-swallowed — the footer can never break because of the sidecar.

`claude-context-keeper` ≥ 1.3.0 uses this so its context
warnings show the **exact same percentage** as this footer, instead of
re-deriving one from the transcript with a guessed window size.

## Requirements

- **`python3`** (recommended) — enables the full footer. Ships with macOS Xcode
  Command Line Tools and is standard on Linux. Also runs under Python 2.
- Without any Python, the footer degrades to **path only** (`📁 ~/dir`).
- The 5h/weekly figures require Claude Code ≳ 2.1.x (older versions don't send
  `rate_limits`; those segments are simply omitted).

## Versioning

The single source of truth is the `# version:` line at the top of
`scripts/statusline.sh`; `plugin.json` mirrors it. Bump both together and add a
`CHANGELOG.md` entry.
